# JWLIA

The task was to recreate the JWLIA About page to the best of my ability. It was a fun exercise/practice and I learned a lot when it comes to clean code and CSS styling.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html & CSS

# What I Learned

I learned to comment and organize my code when it comes to big projects with many lines. I labeled the specific areas to keep my place and to help others read my code efficiently. Although, I did pretty well using floats, I will be practicing Flex box more and trying grid to see my preference.
